This project demonstrates how **AI** and **Machine Learning** can be applied to **loan prediction** in the financial industry. By leveraging **Streamlit**, we've deployed a **Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB)** model that predicts loan approval based on user inputs. The aim is to create a seamless, automated process for loan applications, improving efficiency and accuracy.

## Features
- **Automated Loan Predictions**: Instantly predicts whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on user input.
- **Streamlit Deployment**: The app is deployed using Streamlit, offering an interactive and user-friendly experience.
- **Gaussian Naïve Bayes Model**: A machine learning model trained on a loan prediction dataset.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: The app processes user inputs in real-time to predict loan approval status.
  
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains 13 variables, including:
- **Loan_ID**: Unique loan reference number
- **ApplicantIncome**: The income of the applicant
- **LoanAmount**: The loan amount requested
- **Credit_History**: Key variable indicating the applicant's credit history
- **Property_Area**: The area of the applicant's residence (Urban, Semi-Urban, or Rural)

## Model Overview

The loan prediction model is built using **Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB)**. Key performance metrics:
- **Training Accuracy**: 85.2%
- **Test Accuracy**: 81.82%

The model is trained to predict whether a loan will be approved based on various factors like credit history, income, and property area.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChristopherCastro69/Loan-Prediction.git
```

### 2. Install the required packages
Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and the following packages installed:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn joblib
```

### 3. Run the application
Navigate to the project directory and run the app:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Model Training

The model was trained on **Kaggle** using the loan prediction dataset. You can find the Kaggle notebook here:

- [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaizn69/loan-status-prediction-and-model-deployment)

For training, we used the following features:
- **Applicant Income**
- **Loan Amount**
- **Credit History**
- **Property Area**
- **Dependents**

## Exporting the Model

The trained model was exported using **Pickle** and **Joblib** for integration with the Streamlit app:
```python
from joblib import dump
dump(GNB, 'gnb_model.joblib')
```

## App Deployment

The app is deployed using **Streamlit Community Cloud**. To deploy the app yourself:
1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Log in to Streamlit.
3. Select your GitHub repository and deploy your app.
