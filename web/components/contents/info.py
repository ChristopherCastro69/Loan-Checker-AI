    st.write("**How Does the Loan Process Work?**")
    st.write("When someone applies for a loan, they fill out various details such as their income, marital status, education, credit history, and more. This information is then used by the bank to assess whether the applicant is eligible for a loan. Normally, this process can be time-consuming, requiring manual review. My project seeks to automate this loan approval process in real time, helping banks make faster and more informed decisions.")
    
    st.write("**Data Set Problems 🤔**")
    st.write("The company wants to automate the loan qualifying process. By analyzing the data provided by the applicants through an online form, we can determine if they are eligible for a loan. By using machine learning, we can accelerate the decision-making process and provide real-time results to both the customer and the bank.")
    
    st.write("**Data Set Description 🧾**")
    st.write("The dataset I used for this project contains 13 variables, including 8 categorical, 4 continuous, and 1 ID column. Here's a quick breakdown of the key variables:")
    st.write("- **Loan_ID**: Unique loan reference number")
    st.write("- **Gender**: Applicant's gender")
    st.write("- **Married**: Marital status")
    st.write("- **Dependents**: Number of dependents or family members")
    st.write("- **Education**: Whether the applicant is a graduate")
    st.write("- **Self_Employed**: Self-employment status")
    st.write("- **ApplicantIncome**: Monthly salary or income")
    st.write("- **CoapplicantIncome**: Coapplicant's monthly income")
    st.write("- **LoanAmount**: Requested loan amount")
    st.write("- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Repayment period for the loan")
    st.write("- **Credit_History**: 1 (good credit history) or 0 (bad credit history)")
    st.write("- **Property_Area**: The location of the applicant's property")

    st.write("**Key Numeric Attributes**")
    st.write("By using Z-tests, I analyzed numeric attributes such as **applicant_income** and **loan_amount_term** to detect any significant differences between groups.

    st.write("**Why These Features Matter in Real Life 💡**")
    st.write("In real life, when you apply for a loan, banks don't just look at one factor—they consider a variety of things to assess risk. For example:")
    st.write("- **Credit History**: If you've borrowed money in the past and repaid it responsibly, it shows the bank that you're trustworthy. A bad credit history, on the other hand, raises red flags.")
    st.write("- **Loan Amount Term**: The longer you take to repay the loan, the more risk the bank takes on. A longer loan term can mean smaller monthly payments but higher total interest.")
    st.write("- **Income**: Your monthly salary, as well as any coapplicant's income, helps banks assess if you'll be able to repay the loan. A higher income suggests better financial stability.")
    
    st.write("By feeding all these factors into the machine learning model, I can predict the likelihood of loan approval based on the patterns found in past applications.")
